# 💍 Wedding Brand Guidelines: Athur & Dara

**Date:** [Insert Date]  
**Venue:** Steikhaus, Bandung (Indoor & Semi-Outdoor)  
**Time:** 08:00 - 14:00 (Morning - Afternoon Light)  
**Theme:** Modern Minimalist, White-on-White, Earthy Accents.

---

## 1. The Concept: "Ethereal Earth"
**Keywords:** Clean, Timeless, Bright, Structured, Warm.

We are moving away from rustic/coastal clutter. The goal is to create a **bright, modern sanctuary** inside the vintage architecture of Steikhaus. We will use the existing architectural elements (wood/brick) as a canvas, but overlay them with **clean white blocks and modern floral arrangements** to create a contrast.

* **Mood:** Serenity and sophistication.
* **Key Shift:** Minimizing foliage (greenery), Maximizing blooms (white flowers) and negative space.

## 2. Recommended Color Palette
The palette is 80% White/Neutral to maximize the natural light in the venue, with a subtle Earth Tone accent to bridge the gap with the venue's wooden interior.

| Role | Color Name | Hex Code | Usage |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Primary** | **Paper White** | `#FFFFFF` | Drapes, Main Flowers, Backdrop Base, Stationery Background. |
| **Secondary** | **Bone / Ivory** | `#F5F5F0` | Fabric Runners, Secondary Flowers, Softening transitions. |
| **Accent 1** | **Warm Taupe** | `#A89F91` | **The Earth Tone Accent.** Typography, ribbons, napkins, small structural details. |
| **Accent 2** | **Muted Blush** | `#E5D0CC` | *Very subtle* hints in floral centers or Groom's accessories (Reference to Athur's attire). |

> **🚫 Avoid:** Bright greens, dark heavy browns, or vibrant tropical colors. The look must remain desaturated and matte.

## 3. Recommended Typography
We need a font pairing that screams "Modern" but remains romantic.

### **Primary Typeface (Headings & Initials)**
* **Font:** **Playfair Display** (Serif) or **Tenor Sans** (Sans Serif with character).
* *Why:* It is editorial, clean, and easy to read from a distance.
* *Usage:* "The Wedding of", Section signs (Buffet, Welcome).

### **Secondary Typeface (Body Text)**
* **Font:** **Montserrat** or **Lato** (Light / Regular weight).
* *Why:* Geometric and modern. Easy to read on menus/programs.
* *Usage:* Menu lists, directional signage text, souvenir cards.

### **Accent Typeface (Names/Signatures)**
* **Font:** **Pinyon Script** or **Mrs Saint Delafield**.
* *Why:* A thin, refined script that isn't too "loopy" or old-fashioned.
* *Usage:* Athur & Dara's names on the invitation or backdrop.

## 4. Logo & Monogram Direction
**Style:** Line Art, Interlocking, Minimalist.

* **The Monogram:** The letters **A** and **D** intertwined using thin lines. No thick borders.
* **The Frame:** Instead of a floral wreath, use a **geometric shape** (Arch or Hexagon) or a simple circle with *one* single line art flower stem.
* **Application:**
    * Printed in **Warm Taupe** on White paper.
    * Embossed (Timbul) on the souvenir tag.
    * Neon Sign (Warm White) on the Photobooth backdrop.

## 5. Design & Decoration Recommendations (Vendor Brief)

### **A. The Flowers (The "Green Thumb" Touch)**
* **Variety:** White Phalaenopsis Orchids (Anggrek Bulan), White Roses, Baby's Breath (Gypsophila), and White Anthuriums.
* **Arrangement Style:** **Ikebana or Grouped Styling**. Avoid perfectly round traditional balls of flowers. Make it look structural and airy.
* **Foliage:** Minimal. If leaves are used, use **Dried Palms** (bleached white) or *very* muted Sage Green eucalyptus. No bright green leaves.

### **B. The Tables (Sitting Dinner Layout)**
* **Surface:** Leave the Steikhaus wooden tables exposed (don't cover fully).
* **Runner:** Use a **White or Ivory Chiffon** runner, scrunched loosely down the middle.
* **Centerpiece:**
    * **Option A:** A series of single-stem white flowers in clear minimalist glass vases (various heights).
    * **Option B:** White ceramic pots with mini cactus (referencing Dara's collection) but painted white or planted in white stones to keep it modern.
* **Stationery:** A printed menu card at every seat on White cardstock with Taupe text.

### **C. The Backdrop (Pelaminan)**
* **Structure:** A clean white panel (Arch shape or Rectangular).
* **Texture:** Add dimension using layers of white fabric or a 3D foam texture, NOT excessive rustic wood.
* **Lighting:** Indirect warm uplighting to separate the white backdrop from the white dress (Dara).
