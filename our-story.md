# 📜 Our Journey: From Concert Crowds to Forever

## The Spark: Dec 2023 "One in a Million"

It all started at the TWICE concert. Nervous first impressions turned into excitement amidst the music and lights. We didn't know it yet, but this was literally the prologue

## The Reconnection: Aug 2024 "Jumping into Love"

After some time, we reconnected at Jakarta. We bounced around (pun intended) and realized we wanted to know more about each other

## The Deep Dive: Oct 2024 - Sep 2025 "Catching Feelings"

October was our month. From deep talks to getting emotional over movies, we showed our true colors. Vulnerability became our strength.

## The Commitment: Dec 2025 "Khitbah Day"

The families met, the question was popped (officially), and we bridged our two worlds together. A mix of nerves and pure joy as we locked in our future

## The Beginning: Mar 2026 "The Wedding Day"

And here we are. Ready to start our biggest adventure yet
